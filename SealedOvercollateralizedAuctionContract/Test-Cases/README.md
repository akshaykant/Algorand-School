This subfolder contains demonstration test cases for some of the possible interactions with the overcollateralized 
sealed-bid auction smart contract. The smart contract has the option of first-price (i.e. ordinary) or second-price 
(i.e. Vickrey) types.

All cases include an account that deploys the smart contract. It also funds a seller account and 3 bidder accounts.
The seller creates an NFT. Various combinations of bids and claiming are demonstrated (described in detail at the 
beginning of each file).
Each demo case includes a log file from their example execution on the public Algorand Testnet.
